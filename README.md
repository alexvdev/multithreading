### Multithreading

    Sample code showing multithreading programming issues.

#### Windows
    Initial code intentionally shows the work with bare Windows API as it is described in MSDN.
    Controlling threads code is in threads.cpp.
    Classes used are declared in threads.h. The usage of classes will be extended further.

Any comments or bug reports are welcome.
