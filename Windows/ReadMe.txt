
    Multithreading console application overview
    -------------------------------------------

    Sample application showing usage of basic WinAPI synchronisation objects.
    Initial code intentionally shows the work with bare Windows API
    as it is described in MSDN. 
    Controlling threads code is in threads.cpp.
    Current classes are declared in threads.h. The usage of classes will be
    extended further.

    Any comments or bug reports are welcome.
